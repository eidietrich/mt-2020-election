What NWE is asking the PSC to do by making the $.50 purchase is to shift all the risk of cleaning up Colstrip to us. In January 2013, NWE valued Colstrip at a negative $340 million dollars – in its own words, “due to environmental concerns.” Seven years later two of Colstrip’s plants have shut down, and repair costs for the plant that is still open are estimated at $20 million.

Conflict regarding these issues can arise and are usually settled in legal cases between the PSC and FERC that may or may not involve the governor’s and AG’s office. Given the latest court decisions against the PSC in favor of the solar companies regarding QF contract lengths, it is clear the PSC does not understand how to apply the federal regulations. The commission should have taken a balanced approach of adjusting the avoided cost and contract length per type of generation. These adjustments then should have been applied equally to the utility and the company proposing the QF contract."

If there are economic benefits to be preserved, the burden is on the utility to demonstrate these benefits during the proceedings. The PSC’s process is to determine if it is in the “public interest” or as often stated “reasonable and prudent” (low cost reliable resources). These terms may seem ambiguous, but they do take on meaning in the formal procedure. The case is subject to parties who may argue in favor or against the utilities application.

Moreover, macro-economically, we need to find ways to stand up to China short of all-out trade wars during which our farmers and ranchers become vulnerable. We need Country of Origin Labeling, as well. In addition, we need to advertise Montana-produced goods to a much greater degree, which would provide additional revenue to family-owned farms and to Montana broadly. Finally, we need to replace politicians — from Sonny Perdue to Steve Daines — who favor the big agricultural players over the small guys."
